미국 템플 대학의 연구는
어떻게 이루어졌나?

이 팀은 생후 6개월된 두 그룹 쥐를
준비하고 한 그룹에는 보통 음식을,
또 한 그룹에는 큰숟가락 2수저에
해당되는 카놀라유를 매일 섭취하게
했다고 해요.

생후 1년이 경과한 시점에서
카놀라유를 섭취한 쥐는 그렇지 않은
쥐보다 체중이 무거웠고 더욱이
단기 기억및 작업 기억 등을
체크 한 결과 카놀라유를 섭취한
쥐는 측정 분야 모두에서 학습 능력이
저하 되었다고 한다

he study was approved by the Temple Institutional Animal Care and Usage Committee, 
in accordance with the US National Institutes of Health guidelines. 
The 3xTg mice harboring 3 transgenes (PS1 M146V, tau P301L, and APP Swe) were used in this study16. 
For the study we used both male and female mice. 
Six-month old mice were randomized into two groups: one fed with standard diet (CTR, n = 12), 
* the other with canola oil-enriched diet (50 mg/Kg) (CO, n = 10) for 6 months. 
The control mice used in this study have been previously described15. 
The source of the canola oil added to the diet was 
* “Mazola®” canola oil, which contains 21% total fat 
* (1gr saturated fatty acids, 4gr polyunsaturated fatty acids, and 8 gr of monounsaturated fatty acids per serving).
Fresh diet was provided every other day. 
Mice underwent behavioral tests
 at 12 months (6 months treatment) of age as described below and a week later euthanized. 
After perfusion, brains were removed 
and immediately dissected in two halves: one was stored at −80 °C for biochemistry; 
the other fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, pH7.4 for immunohistochemistry.
